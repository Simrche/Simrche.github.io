        <h2><strong>GAMNED! DATA PROTECTION CHARTER</strong></h2>
            <p>Free access to many sites on the Internet is made possible by the dissemination, by advertisers, of advertisements. These advertisements can be targeted on the basis of the needs and expectations of the Internet users concerned or untargeted, which are less likely to interest them. In all cases, Internet users are exposed to advertising.</p>
            <p>Advertisers, for their part, are also interested in displaying their offers to users whom they know to be interested in them.</p>
            <p>When Gamned! (Where &quot; <strong>We</strong> &quot;,&quot; <strong>Our</strong> &quot;,&quot; ») Is mandated by an advertiser, our main mission is to reconcile the interests of Internet users and advertisers. To do this, we strive to preserve the confidentiality and security of the personal data that we process in the context of the campaigns entrusted to us by our advertiser clients, namely all information allowing direct identification (name, first name, profile picture, etc.) or indirectly (client or advertising ID, IP address, etc.) a natural person (the &quot; <strong>Personal data</strong> &quot;).</p>
            <p>To this end, we have put in place strict procedures and made strong commitments which are described in this document (the “ <strong>Protection Charter</strong> &quot;).</p>
            <p><strong>1. When does the Protection Charter apply?</strong></p>
            <p>The Protection Charter applies as soon as you communicate voluntarily (having given your authorization for an advertiser to send you targeted advertising, etc.) or that Gamned! collects your Personal Data (by subscribing to Our newsletter, by creating a customer account with Our sales department).</p>
            <p><strong>2. Who are we?</strong></p>
            <p>Gamned! is a <em>trading desk </em>and a publisher of programmatic solutions. Information about Gamned !, is available on our <a href="https://en.gamned.com/fr/legal-notices/">Legal notice</a>.</p>
            <p>Gamned! is referenced as <em>vendor</em> <em>Transparency and Consent Framework</em> of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Europe - association of web advertising producers. Such referencing allows Internet users to choose, on any site equipped with a Consent Management Platform, which data it authorizes which entities to collect.</p>
            <p>Likewise, Gamned! follows the recommendations of the platform of choice <strong>YOC </strong><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/"><strong>&quot;Youronlinechoices&quot;</strong></a> which allows Internet users to deactivate all the cookies that Gamned! and other member companies would have placed on their computers.</p>
            <p><strong>3. What are Our commitments?</strong></p>
            <p>Gamned! has made the protection of Personal Data and respect for privacy one of its priorities. We have thus chosen to work towards greater transparency and to offer real visibility to users regarding the collection and processing of their Personal Data on the Internet, including the use of cookies.</p>
            <p>Gamned! undertakes to process your Personal Data in strict compliance with the Regulations (defined below), the lawful instructions of our customers, data controllers and this Protection Charter.</p>
            <p>Thus, and by virtue of the principle of data minimization, Gamned! ensures that it only processes Personal Data that is strictly necessary with regard to the explicit, legitimate and determined purposes for which they are processed. The processing operations will only be carried out for the duration necessary for the accomplishment of the purposes concerned and within the framework of strict security and confidentiality measures.</p>
            <p>These purposes have also been brought to the attention of Our Data Protection Officer (DPO) during the prior formalities carried out with the latter.</p>
            <p><strong>4. What regulations are applicable to the use of your Personal Data?</strong></p>
            <p>The regulations applicable to the processing of Personal Data cover all the laws and regulations, national and European, in force and in particular (i) the European Regulation 2016/679 on data protection of April 27, 2016 (the &quot; <strong>GDPR</strong> &quot;), (Ii) the French provisions of law n ° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended by law n ° 2018-493 of June 20, 2018, (iii) European directive 2002/58 / EC of 12 July 2002 and (iv) the guidelines, opinions, recommendations, opinions of the supervisory authorities and the certifications, approvals or final court decisions (together, the &quot; <strong>Regulation</strong> &quot;).</p>
